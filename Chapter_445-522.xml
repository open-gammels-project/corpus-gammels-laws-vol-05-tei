<salute>Joint Resolution authorizing the Governor to appoint an agent to take possession of the Salt Lake known as &#8216;El Sol del Rey.&#8217; and to pay over the revenues arising therefrom to the State.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, a valuable Salt Lake exists in Hidalgo county, known as &#8220;El Sol del Rey,&#8221; which was reserved as the property of the crown of Spain, the title to which became vested in the State of Texas, when title, inasmuch as said lake could not be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lawfully patented, could not be lost by prescription; and whereas, it is desirable to secure the revenues of the said lake for the State, and at the same time supply the people with salt at a reasonable rate, therefore&#8212;</p>
<p>Section 1. Be it resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That by this joint resolution, which is to take effect from and after its passage, the Governor is authorized and required to appoint an agent whose duty it shall be to take and hold possession of the salt lake mentioned in the preamble hereof, in behalf of the State of Texas, and to collect and pay over the revenues arising therefrom into the Trasury of the State.</p>

<p>Sec. 6. That in case any person or persons shall claim to have title to said salt lake, such person or persons shall have the privilege of sueing the State at any time within one year from and after the taking possession of the same by the State, and not thereafter, in the District Court having jurisdiction of the same; provided, that such person or persons shall, in their petition, set forth clearly and fully how the title claimed originated, and how it is derived, filing it with certified copies of each of the title papers intended to be adduced and relied on at the trial; and provided further, that service of certified copies of such petition, and copies of such title papers upon the Attorney General shall be held to be sufficient service upon the State.</p>

<salute>Joint Resolution.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, a crisis has arrived which involves the civilization, institutions, political and social rights of the people of Texas, making it proper and expe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dient that the Representatives in the Legislature should, in the most solemn manner, declare to her sister States, composing the Confederate States of America, and to the world, her settled conviction of the wanton injustice of the war now waged against them by the Northern States, and of her unfalter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing determination to co-operate with her sister States in prosecuting the war to a triumphant termination by all means, and at all hazards. And, whereas, it is a historical fact, known to the nations of Europe, that the independence of the thirteen original Colonies was separately acknowledged, and that these <pb n="507" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="63" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw> distinct sovereignties formed a voluntary union, under the name and style of the United States of America; while it is a fact known to the people of the United States, that these sovereign States never did merge their sovereignty into the Governmnt of the United States, but that they only delegated to it certain expressed, limited and specific powers, while they reserved to themselves the exercise of all other powers, not so delegated, and lest it should be inferred that they had parted with that sovereignty, several States, and Virginia among the number, did, along with the act of entering the Union, declare their right of withdrawal, and notwithstanding those decisive facts the right is denied us, and the amazing spectacle is presented to the world of the attempt to ignore the sover<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eignty and rights of thirteen States, and by war to subjugate and hold in vassalage 10,000,000 of people, thus seeking to overthrow the fundamental principles which underlie the theory of our Government, and upon which the whole system rests&#8212; and in the destruction of which there is inseparably joined the submission and over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />throw of Republicanism; and, whereas, we declare, that for the sake of the Union such as was bequeathed to us by a common ancestry; we have for long years sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted to enormous taxation, and to a monopoly of the coasting and fishing boun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties. But not content with this odious system of material robbery, they have sought to rob us of our just reputation abroad. And not only so, but through mis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />representation we are regarded as the destroyers of the Union, and themselves as politically striving to preserve it, when in fact they have long since destroyed it, all but in name, and are to-day the willing subjects of a coarse and vulgar despot<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ism. But notwithstanding all this, it was not until they denied us equality in the Union, and had succeeded by&#39;a sectional issue in placing in power a President, and in the halls of Congress a majority, pledged to cany out these measures, that the people of the South rose up in their majesty and accepted the issue of war rather than submit to the disgrace of social and political inequality. For many years they have been engaged in making a moral war upon us, and now after thus assailing ns and our institutions, they have actually invaded our territory, with fire and sword, proclaiming in advance the confiscation of our property, the appropriation of our homestead, and if possible, by means of servile insurrection, to shed the blood of helpless infancy and age, having already practiced outrages upon defenceless women too horrible for utterance. And whereas, we now solemnly declare that there is no common bond of union between the North and South, and further, that there is no homogeneity either in moral or religious sentiment or pursuits. And whereas, we hereby congratulate our sister Confederate States upon the wisdom of our rulers, the skill of our Generals, the valor of onr soldiers and the general suc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cess of our cause, and assure them that the people of Texas are even more than ever prepared to devote their entire and united energies to the successful prosecution of this war, whatever proportions it may assume or whatever sacrifices it may demand. Therefore,</p>
<p>Resolved, 1st, That the people of Texas do hereby assure her sister Confederate States and the world that she stands ready with heart and hand to resist our in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vaders until their last soldier is driven from our borders, and until we shall conquer an honorable and glorious peace.</p>
<p>2d. That we reiterate the declaration that the States which composed the United States did not merge their sovereignty into that Government, but that they entered into a voluntary compact, and that they had the right of their own volition to withdraw, and that the attempt by fire and sword to compel them to remain in the Union, would, if successful, blot out the sovereignty and existence of the seceded States, and place in vassalage 10,000,000 of free people.</p>
<p>3d. That the Southern States have, in the extreme patience with which they have submitted to oppressive legislation, given indubitable evidence of their love for the Union framed by our fathers.</p>
<p>4th. That the pretensions of patriotism on the part of the North, in waging a war for the Union, is an enormous falsehood, and that their sole object in <pb n="508" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="64" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw> its preservation, is that they may continue to plunder the South, and retain the power to render us the victims of their avarice.</p>
<p>5th. That the proximate cause of the dissolution of the Union was that the North had the power and had avowed the determination to deprive the South of social and political equality.</p>
<p>6th. That we hold them up before the world, with all their pretensions to superior civilization, as waging a war so barbarous as to be unknown to the warfare of civilized nations, and such as is disgraceful to the era in which they live.</p>
<p>7th. That we utterly disclaim all affinity, all brotherhood with them, and that we rejoice that we have escaped the contaminating influence of their base fanaticism.</p>
<p>8th. That no overtures of peace should be considered which do not as an indis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pensable pre-requisite propose the recognition of the Independence of these Con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />federate States, and that any offer on the part of the enemy to treat of peace which does not propose the recognition of our Independence, in advance, and to make that recognition the basis of negotiations, is an insult to our people and Government, and should be spurned as such.</p>
<p>9th. That we have unlimited confidence in the wisdom of our President, the skill of our Generals, the courage of our soldiers, and in the final and glorious triumph of our cause.</p>
<p>10th. That the Governor of this State be requested to forward a copy of these resolutions to each of our Representatives in Congress, and to the Governor of each of the Confederate States, with a request that they be laid before their respective Legislatures.</p>
