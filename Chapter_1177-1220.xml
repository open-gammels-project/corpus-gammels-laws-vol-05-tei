<salute>Joint Resolution in relation to removal of United States Troops.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Whereas, By the result of the late war between the Confederate States and the United States, the President of the United States thought proper, in order to aid the civil authorities in the main<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tenance of order and good conduct within the State of Texas, to quarter within said State, United States troops.</p>
<p>And whereas, many months have elapsed since the cessation of hostilities, and the publication and almost unanimous accep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tance of the proclamation of the President of the United States, granting amnesty and pardon to the people of said State, restor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing them to citizenship in said Government, entitling them to all the benefits resulting therefrom; and whereas, the State has been restored to civil government, and the civil authorities are, and will be able to maintain order and good conduct within said <pb n="1179" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="261" /><fw type="header" place="top">Joint Resolutions.</fw>State, by and with the support, willingly given, of the whole people of said State, without the aid of the military.</p>
<p>And whereas, for many reasons not necessary here to enumerate, the troops quartered in said State are an injury to the advancement of the much needed work of restoration of civil government.</p>
<p>And whereas further, the frontier of the State of Texas, on the North-west, is without that military aid and protection which is necessary, and which it must have, or the citizens thereof be com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pelled to abandon their much loved homes and return into the in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terior of the State, thereby giving up to the savage Indian all that portion of our State, and at the same time, thereby bringing with them the frontier, that is, subjecting the people of the interior, who are now free from the ravages of the heartless savage, to all the inconveniences of frontier life.</p>
<p>And whereas further, if the troops now uselessly quartered in the interior of the State were removed to the frontier, they would be able to give the necessary protection to the people thereof, as well as the people of the whole State: Now, therefore,</p>
<p>Be it resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the people of the State have in good faith returned to their allegiance to the Government of the United States, and having a full deter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mination to stand to, abide by, and comply with the Constitution and laws made in pursuance thereof, the Governor of the State be requested to use all proper means to assure the President of the United States thereof; and that he be further requested to use all legitimate means to obtain the removal of the United States troops now quartered in Texas, and that they, or others, in sufficient num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bers to give protection, be stationed on the frontier of the State as early as practicable.</p>

<p>Whereas, The isssue of the late unhappy war has changed the whole domestic economy of the South.
