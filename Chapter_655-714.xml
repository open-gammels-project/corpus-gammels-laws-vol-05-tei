This shall be the construction: If the person, firm, or association be partly or entirely enterested in the retailing, as if it were done by any disconnected person; and a trust or donation for the purpose of retailing shall receive the same kind of construing. Neither kind of tax shall be evaded by any blending of wholesale and retail interests, nor by any arrangement of trust or gift; and every person making such respective disposal of any such article, shall dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tinctly and separately account therefor, as in case of an ordinary sale; and tax shall be paid, in every case, on fair market value.</p>

<p>Sec. 5. The sale of any distilled spirit, fermented liquor, or wine of bad quality is absolutely prohibited; and any such article shall be so regarded when adulterated or tinctured with any poisonous or unhealthful substance, or when its strength shall be under second proof as known in market, or as may be otherwise ascertained. In each county the County Court shall establish proper tests for ascertaining the quality of such articles, and shall have authority to apply the test in any reason<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able manner. Also, the Assessor and Collector shall have authority, in any proper manner, to ascertain the qualities of such articles, either by applying the tests, that may be established by the Court, if any, or by the use of other appropriate means. But sales of wine made within this State and not adulterated nor tinctured with any poisonous or unhealthful substance, although in strength below second proof, shall not be within the foregoing prohibition.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. The taxes imposed by this law shall apply to sales to be made out of this State, of such articles taken from it for market, as well as to sales made within this State; and the person, firm, or association, who shall make any preparation or movement of such an article in commencing so to take it from this State for market, or who shall make any committal of such an article to any person, that he may take it from the State for market, shall pay this tax, which shall be assessed and collected promptly, on the value of the subject of such preparation, movement, or committal, on an estimate of such value, to be made by the Assessor and Collector according to the current market value of the article in his county, as if sale had been therein completed at such value.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. Within the first ten days of every month, each person, firm, or association, liable for such taxes, shall render to the Assessor and Collector of the county, where sales shall have been made, or from which articles have been taken for market, or in which preparation, movement, or committal shall have been made, as aforesaid, a true account of the articles so sold, or taken from this State for market, or pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pared, moved, or committed therefor, during the next preceding month. Such ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />count, as to wholesale tarnsactions, shall show, respectively, dates of sale, to whom sold, kinds and quantities sold, and prices per gallon, or like particulars, as far as practicable, in relation to articles taken from this State for market, or prepared, moved, or committed therefor. Such account, as to retail transactions, shall show like particulars, except to whom sold. And, at any other time, on demand of the Assessor and Collector, any person, firm, or association, so liable to render an ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />count, shall do so within two days from such demand. Also, any person, firm, or association, so liable, shall show to the Assessor and Collector, on his demand, to be made in a reasonable manner, an account book or other memorandum, respectively of each foregoing particular. Every account, account-book, or memorandum, to be rendered or shown, as aforesaid, in order to meet the requisition therefor, must be verified by some person liable therefor; and such verification must show, that the account, account-book, or memorandum, respectively, contain a fully just, and true exhibition of the facts, required to be shown by such means. Such verification must be made by written affidavit, stating particulars according to the nature of the case, subscribed by the person making it, sworn to before some officer authorized to administer oaths, including the Assessor and Collector, and delivered to him. Every such affidavit shall be filed in the office of the Clerk of the County Court.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. If any such affidavit shall be wilfully false, the person making it shall be guilty of perjury, and shall be subject to punishment as in other cases of perjury. Moreover, if any person shall violate any of the other provisions of this law, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, indictable in the District Court; <pb n="674" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="20" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw> and, on conviction, he shall be punished by fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment, not exceeding six months, or in both modes, in the discretion of the jury trying the case; and each person included in a firm or association, so violating these other provisions, shall be liable to these penalties.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Any person, firm, or association, at the end of each month, shall be liable for payment of the taxes, which shall have accrued against him or them in that month, and shall pay the same to the Assessor and Collector within the first ten days after the end of the month; and, in case the Assessor and Collector at any time shall demand an account, as before provided, he shall then demand pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of the taxes, that shall have previously accrued, without reference to monthly time, and they shall be paid within two days allowed, for rendering the account so demanded. Any person, who shall have become liable for any of such taxes, shall so continue until payment, notwithstanding any punishment that may be inflicted under this law. The Assessor and Collector of the county wherein the taxes shall have accrued, shall collect the, same, and may sue therefor in the name of the State, if necessary; and, in any such case of suit the defendant or defendants, shall be liable to judgment and execution for the taxes, and for the amount of fifty per cen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tum thereon. Whenever such suit shall be necessary, it shall be prosecuted to judg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment and execution without delay, notwithstanding any law for suspending the col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lection of ordinary debts.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. The subjects of taxation under this law shall not be liable to taxation by any other county, city or town.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. All laws contrary to the provisions of this act are suspended during its continuance in force; and this act shall be in force from its passage until the close of the present war and the ratification of a treaty of peace between the Confederate States of America and the United States of America.</p>

And such process may be executed by the Assessor and Collector, or the Sheriff, or the Coroner, or a Constable.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. Any tax on property, as prescribed by law, when the property shall have been assessed, shall be a lien thereon for payment of the tax; and the lien shall continue, with liability for its enforcement, until the property shall have beeen re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lieved therefrom by legal payment or relinquishment of the tax.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. All laws that are incompatible with this law are repealed; but it shall not be construed as repealing the existing laws authorizing County Courts to levy and collect taxes.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. This act shall be in force from its passage.</p>

<salute>An Act to provide for the Defense of the State.</salute>
</opener>
<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernor of the State is hereby empowered to continue in the service of the State, the State Militia now in the field, for the term of six months after their present term of service expires. He is hereby further empowered, to order into the same service, the Militia now remaining at home. These powers are to be exercised when he shall deem the said Militia necessary to enforce the laws, suppress insurrections or to repel invasion, and are to be subject to the restrictions hereinafter expressed.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The Governor shall order all the Militia, not now in the field, to be en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rolled, and without loss of time after such enrollment, the men so enrolled, shall proceed to, and become members of, the companies, battalions and regiments raised in their several counties and brigade districts. Such enrollment shall be made within one month preceding the expiration of the term of service of the Militia now in the field, and in time to allow those enrolled to join their companies before the expira<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of said term of service.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. When the time shall have arrived for the term of service of the Militia now in the field to expire, there shall be a reorganization of the Militia, by the elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of company and field officers. At said election, all those shall be allowed to vote who are now in the field, and also those who shall have joined their companies prior to such reorganization.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The whole number of Militia, except commissioned officers, thus organized, shall be divided into three classes, to be called the First Class, the Second Class, and the Third Class. The third class shall be com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posed of those who are not now in the field, and who shall be ordered there under the provisions of this law. The commanding officers of brigades, unattached companies, battalions and regiments, shall divide the Militia now in the field, into two classes, in the following manner: There shall be put in a hat, for each company now in the field, as many tickets as there are private soldiers in such company. One-half of these tickets shall be numbered one, and one-half shall be num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bered two. The roll shall be called, and each man, as his name is called, shall draw <pb n="699" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="45" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw> out a ticket. Those drawing a ticket marked one, shall be of the first class, and those drawing a ticket marked two, shall be of the second class. Should any man be absent, then the officer in command of such company, shall draw for him. This classification shall be made at the time of the reorganization, as ordered in section three of this act. The non-commissioned officers shall, at the same time, and in the same manner, be classified, but shall draw separately from the private soldiers. But persons in the Militia liable to service in the army of the Confederate States, shall not be classified, or furloughed, as hereinafter provided.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Such reorganization and classification being completed, all those of the first class shall be furloughed for the term of three months, at the expiration of which, they shall return to their respective companies, and at that time all those of the second class shall be furloughed for a like time, and so, also, with the third class. Commanders of brigades shall devise a system of leaves of absence for commissioned officers, in such manner as to grant them, without detriment to the country, rea<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sonable time to visit their families and attend to necessary business.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. If any person not now in the Militia in the field, but liable, under this act, to be called into service, shall be called into service, and shall fail, without reason<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able excuse, to join his company or regiment, as herein required, he shall be deemed guilty of desertion, and may be proceeded against, tried and punished according to the articles of war and regulations for the army of the Confederate States.</p>
<p>Sec. 7. The Militia of this State, organized according to the provisions of this act, and under the immediate command of officers appointed by the Governor, may by him be put under the orders of the commander of the army of the Confederate States in the District of Texas, the Confederate States paying, subsisting and cloth<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing the said Militia as Confederate troops. Said Militia shall not be sworn into the service of the Confederate States, but shall always remain liable to the ultimate control of the Governor, if he deem it proper at any time to exercise such control; and they may, at any time, by him withdrawn or disbanded.</p>
<p>Sec. 8. In all cases when the Militia of this State shall be in the field, under an order from the Governor, or act of the Legislature, and the Confederate States shall refuse to grant them pay, subsistence and allowances as to Confederate troops, then the Militia shall have pay, subsistence and allowances, the same as allowed to Con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />federate troops, to be furnished by this State.</p>
<p>Sec. 9. Should, the Governor disband the Militia, the said classification and or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganization shall not be destroyed. In that case the Militia shall be a reserve force, to be again called out should accasion require, and such call shall be made upon the two classes whose turn it is to be in the field, it being the object of this act to retain always at home, one-third of the Militia of the State, and to keep two<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thirds of the Militia in active service during the present war, whenever there shall be necessity of such service.</p>
<p>Sec. 10. No person who has a substitute in the Militia now in the field, and who, if he had not such substitute, would be liable to Militia duty, shall because of having furnished a substitute, be deemed exempt from Militia duty, after the expiration of the present term of service of the Militia now in the field; but such person shall be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />long to the first or second class of Militia, as shall be determined by lot, and when the lots are drawn, as provided in section three, he shall draw with the rest, if he be present, and if not, the officer in command of the company shall draw for him, and the substitute, if liable to Militia duty, shall belong to the third class.</p>
<p>Any person belonging to either of the classes may, with the consent of the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />manding officer of his company, exchange places with another of a different class in the same company.</p>
<p>Sec. 11. This Act shall be in force from and after its passage, and shall remain in force until the termination of the present war between the Confederate States and the United States.</p>

<p>Whereas, the State troops were called out by the proclamation of His Excel<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lency Governor Lubbock, in 1862, and these troops were transferred to the Con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />federate Commander of the State of Texas; and, whereas, supplies to meet the wants of these troops were furnished by individual advancement and credit, &#38;c., which have not been reimbursed or met by either State or Confederacy:</p>
<p>Therefore, be it resolved by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the Adjutant and Inspector General of the State be and is hereby instructed to inquire into the cause of the non-payment of any or all claims in the premises, and to take such steps as will properly adjust the rights of all concerned.</p>

<p>Whereas, the present war, waged by the Government of the United States upon the Government, people and property of the Confederate States, is without prece<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dent in its atrocious and unchristian character; and, whereas, the comparative exemption of our own dear State from many of the more dire concomitants of war, may have been construed as a cause for our unanimity in sustaining our Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment:</p>
<p>1. Therefore, be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That now that our presumptuous enemy treads our soil in heavy number and menacing atti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tude, we bid him a proud and scornful defiance.</p>
<p>2. That we pledge to our sister States, that in this struggle, our authorities and our people will evince a patriotism and endurance as great as the occasion and as prolonged as the conflict.</p>
<p>3. That although as a free people, we have exercised the right of criticism upon the acts of our President and his Cabinet, yet we here record our full con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fidence in the patriotism and ability of President Davis; and do furthermore de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />clare, that if remitted now to our option, we would not exchange him for any citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zen of the Confederacy, as the pilot to carry us through the present stormy strug<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gle for liberty as a people, and for independence as a nation.</p>
