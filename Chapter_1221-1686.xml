<p>Sec. 4. That every free white male person, who shall have at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tained the age of twenty-one years, and become a citizen of this State, and shall have resided within the limits of said city for twelve months next preceding the election, shall be entitled to vote for Mayor and Aldermen of said city.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. That for the purpose of holding elections for city officers, the said city shall be divided into four wards, to contain as near as may be practicable and convenient, an equal number of voters; and it shall be the duty of the board of Aldermen to alter said wards from time to time, in such manner as to preserve as nearly as may be, an aproximated equality of voters. The Mayor shall be elected by the qualified voters of the city, voting by ballot in their respective wards, and shall hold his office for one year from the date of his election, and until his successor shall be elected and qualified. At the first election held under this charter, there shall be elected by the same voters voting in their respective wards, two Aldermen from the first ward, two Alderm n from the second ward, two Aldermen from the third ward, and two Aldermen from the fourth ward, according <pb n="1409" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="189" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>to the provisions of the next succeeding section of this act.

The managers shall hold the polls open from ten o&#8217;clock, a. m., until four o&#8217;clock p. m., and shall keep a cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rect list of all persons admitted by them to vote, numbering each voter, and marking each ticket with a corresponding number, as in the case of State elections.

<p>Sec. 2. The capital of said company shall consist of not more than ten million of dollars divided into shares of one hundred dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars each, and fifty per cent. thereof shall be appropriated for and used as the active capital, and fifty per cent. shall be invested by the Directors in good securities and held as a reserved fund, pledged for the payment of any contingent liability which may be created in the course of their business; and should any part of the reserved fund be at any time used in payment of any such liabilities, it shall be the duty of the Directors to reinstate the sums thus used by ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />propriating thereto so much of the current income as may be requis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ite therefor; and no distribution of profits shall, at any time be made, so long as there may be any deficiency in the funds reserved as aforesaid; and George W.

Pechin, are hereby ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed Commissioners, and they, or a majority of them may, in person or by proxy, at such times and places as they may deem expedient, open books of subscription, and when five thousand shares shall have been subscribed, and twenty per cent. thereon shall have been satisfactorily secured, the subscribers may pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceed to organize the company by the appointment of five or more directors; and the directors for the time being, in the name and behalf of the company, are hereby authorized and empowered to have, exercise, and enjoy all the rights, powers and privileges which are intended to be herein given to the said company, and may from time to time, increase the resources of the company by ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />taining money or credit on a pledge of their property, or without such pledge, or by new subscriptions, and any citizen or subject, person, company or corporation of any State, government or country may subscribe for purchase and hold shares in the said company; and the owners of such shares shall be liable for and bound to pay to the said company the sums due or to become due by them upon such shares, which sum or <pb n="1615" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="395" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>sums being paid, such owner shall not be liable for any further payment on account thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. And whereas experience has proved that the payment of a proper rate of interest upon deposis will promote economy and industry, and create a fund, which, under proper regulations, se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curing punctuality in payments, may be safely advanced upon long loans, to be repaid in suitable instalments; and whereas the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />centration of capital and credit, under such regulations would en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able the company, by such loans, to give profitable employment to labor, and aid in the development of the agricultural, mining, man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ufacturing and other industrial resources of this and the other States; and inasmuch as the greater security for the repayment of such deposits will tend to lessen the rate of interest to be paid thereon, therefore, in case of deposits which are subject to be with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />drawn by check or by order, the persons making such deposits may agree with the said company that there shall be deposited with the Treasurer of this State, or with some other person, as Trustee, bonds of the United States, or of one of the said States, or such other se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curities as may be agreed on, for a sum equal to the deposit so made, which deposits the Treasurer is hereby authorized to receive and hold as collateral securities for the repayment of the deposits aforesaid; and the company may issue a certificate, stating the amount of the deposit, the interest to accrue thereon the time when, and the terms and conditions on which payment is to be made; which certificate shall be countersigned by a competent person appointed by the Treasurer, with the assent of the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany, or in case of any other person acting as trustee, then by such person, who shall witness that repayment of such deposits has been secured by a pledge of securities held in trust for that purpose. And the said certificates may be made payable to order or to bearer; provided, that no certificate shall be issued for a less amount than the whole sum, which the payee in such certificate may leave on deposit with said company, and provided, further that such certificate shall not circulate as money; and should any such certificate not be paid upon demand after the same becomes due and payable, the holder thereof may cause protest to be made, and thirty days&#8217; notice having been given to the said company, if the requisite funds be not otherwise provided, it shall be the duty of the Treasurer or Trustee to sell so many of the bonds or other securities held by him in trust, as aforesaid, as may be necessary therefor, and with the proceeds of such sales to pay off and discharge the said protested certificates, and the expense of protest; provided, that if the sum realized <pb n="1616" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="396" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>from the sales of such bonds or other securities be not sufficient to pay the sum due on said certificates and cost of protest, the payee therein on making oath to the fact, shall have summary at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tachment against the property of said company, and cause the same to be sold after ten days&#8217; notice; and the Treasurer or Trustee may receive the interest and dividends falling due on the bonds and securities deposited with him, which, after deducting a reasonable compensation for his servces not exceeding five hundred dollars, shall be paid over to the said company, who shall pay to the person countersigning their certificates a reasonable compensation therefor. And whereas the funds and securities deposited as aforesaid, and the funds and credits into which the same may be converted, will be held by the company for the benefit of the said depositors, and the taxes thereon, if any, should be paid by the persons to whom the said funds and credits properly belong, such deposits and the funds and credits created thereby shall not be assessed or taxed as the property of the said company.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. The by-laws may prescribe the number of, and the man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ner in which the Directors, officers and agents of the company shall be appointed, and designate their terms of service, powers, duties and compensation. The company shall have an office in this State, but the Directors, under such rules and regulations as they may ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />prove, may establish branches and agencies in this and the other States, and in Europe, and elsewhere, and may unite and be con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />solidated with other companies organized in other States for like purposes; and when so united shall not be required to pay a tax upon the shares of such other company, unless such shares shall be owned by persons residing in this State; and the Directors may require all their officers and agents to take an oath that they will honestly and faithfully, to the best of their ability, discharge their respective duties.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Whenever the said company shall have paid off the sums due on any of the certificates, to secure the payment of which they have deposited bonds or securities as aforesaid, and shall have can<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />celled the same, it shall be the duty of the Treasurer or Trustee, as the case may be, to release and deliver to the said company, bonds and securities deposited with him as aforesaid, to an amount equal to the deposits made to secure the payment of the certificates thus paid and cancelled.</p>
<p>Sec. 6. This act shall take effect and be in force for thirty years from and after its passage.</p>
