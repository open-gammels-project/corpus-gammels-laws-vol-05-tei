<p>Whereas, at a special election held in the city of Galveston on the 19th May, 1858, the people of said city did almost unanimously vote for the creation of a debt of said city to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars, for the purpose of constructing a bridge from Galveston Island to Virginia Point on the mainland, in aid of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad; and, whereas, in pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />suance of said expressed wish of the people of said city, the corporate authorities of said city, did pass and approve an ordinance on the 26th day of August, 1858, authorizing a contract for the construc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of said bridge, section 5th of which ordinance is as follows: &#8220;Sec. 5th. That it shall be the duty of the Mayor, whenever, after a contract shall be entered into for the construction of the aforesaid work, it shall be in his opinion, or that of the city council requisite and necessary to do so, to issue the bonds of the corporation of this city, to the extent of one hundred thousand dollars, or as much thereof as may be necessary for the construction of said bridge, and cause the same to be negotiated in such a manner, and by such means as he may deem most conducive to the interests of the city, the said bonds to be in <pb n="44" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="4" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw> sums of not less than one hundred, nor more than one thousand dollars, to be payable in not less than twelve nor more than twenty years from the date thereof, and to bear interest of and at the rate of not more than ten per centum per annum, which interest shall be payable semi-annually on presentation and surrender of the coupons to be thereto attached.&#8221;</p>

<p>Section 1.
