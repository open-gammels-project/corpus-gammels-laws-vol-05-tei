But if the goods, chattels, or effects first seized, shall be insufficient to satisfy said tax, pen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />alties and costs, then the tax officer shall make an additional levy and sale, and shall so continue, until said tax, penalties and costs are satisfied, or until the goods, chattels or effects of such delin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quent are exhausted, and no levy upon the real property of such delinquent shall be made until all the personal property be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />longing to such delinquent within his county is exhausted; and should such delinquent be possessed of personal property within the county, elsewhere than in the county in which the rendition is made, it is hereby made the duty of the Assessor and Collector to make out the tax bill, including all costs which may have accrued, and after stating that the same is correct, and still unpaid, shall sign the same, and forward it to the Assessor and Collector of the county in which the property is situated, for collection, who shall receipt therefor, to the Assessor and Collector sending it, and thereafter it becomes his duty to account therefor to the Comp<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />troller of Public Accounts, who shall charge the amount of the taxes and penalties specified in said tax bill and receipt, to such Assessor and Collector, and credit the tax officer sending it with a like amount: and when collected, the amount of fees due the Assessor and Collector, from whom it was received, shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted to him by the tax officer collecting it, by mail, if not other<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />wise directed.

<p>Sec. 23.

But the mere pos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />session of the certificate of purchase shall convey no rights of ownership over the property thus acquired, and any trespass committed upon such property prior to the execution of the deed therefor, shall subject the trespasser to all the punishment in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curred thereby; Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be so contsrued as to authorize the sale of the homestead for the <pb n="1073_" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="155" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>payment of any tax, except such taxes as may be assessed upon the value of the homestead.</p>
