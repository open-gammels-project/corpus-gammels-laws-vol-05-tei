<p>Whereas, Within the last six months whole families of loyal citizens of the United States have been shamefully and brutally murdered by Indians upon the Northwest frontier of Texas; and, whereas, a large number of women and children have been carried into captivity by remorseless savages, whose depredations upon life and property are daily becoming more frequent and bold; and, whereas, the protection of the frontier from depredations by hos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tile Indians, has always been, and is now, a matter of great im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portance to the people of Texas; and, whereas, a large portion of the Northwest border is now, and has been for several months, al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />most entirely at the mercy of hostile Indians, and, under the force of existing circumstances, is likely to remain in that unfortunate condition until the United States military posts shall have been re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />established along the frontier border; and, whereas, we rely upon the disposition and ability of the United States Government to re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />establish those military posts, and to protect the frontier.

<p>Whereas, the State of Texas possesses an area of one hundred and seventy-five million, five hundred and ninety-four thousand acres of Inad, (very little of which is not adapted to agricultural or pasturage purposes) through which her enterprising citizens have in contem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plation a net work of railroads, four hundred and sixty miles being now in running order, one of which roads commences at the Eastern boundary of the State, running West to Houston, and there connect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing with others extending to Galveston; to Columbia, on the Brazos; to the River Colorado, at Columbus; to Brenham, and on the line known as the Central Railroad, extending to the distance of one hundred and forty miles, from the Port of Galveston; none of which railroads have any present connection with those of other States;</p>
<p>Whereas, the Convention of Texas, now assembled at Austin, has assurances that there is in course of construction, from St. Louis, in the State of Missouri; the Southwest Branch Railroad to the Indian Territory; also, that the Leavenworth, Lawrence and Port Gibson Railroad is being built, South to the North line of the Indian Ter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ritory, connecting with the Union Pacific Railroad.</p>
